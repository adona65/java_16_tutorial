		 * Sealed Classes was introduced in java 15 as a preview feature (watch java 15 tutorials for more details).
		 * 
		 * It's still a preview feature in java 16 that do some additions to this feature :
		 * - The Java language recognizes sealed, non-sealed, and permits as contextual keywords (similar to abstract and extends).
		 * - Restrict the ability to create local classes that are subclasses of a sealed class (similar to the inability to create 
		 *   anonymous classes of sealed classes).
		 * - Stricter checks when casting sealed classes and classes derived from sealed classes
